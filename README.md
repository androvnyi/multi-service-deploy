## Multi-Service Deploy (Flask + PostgreSQL + Nginx)

### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to fully automate the deployment of multiple services on a remote server using **Ansible** and **Docker Compose**.

After running a single Ansible playbook, the production server will automatically start three containers:
- **Flask API** – a simple Python backend application
- **PostgreSQL** – a database used by the API
- **Nginx** – a reverse proxy that routes incoming traffic to the API

The automation covers:
- Installing and configuring Docker & Docker Compose
- Deploying application code and configuration files
- Setting up secrets via **Ansible Vault**
- Running the complete service stack with `docker-compose`

---

### Why This Project Is Useful
This setup is a practical example of a **multi-service deployment pipeline**.  
By building it, you will practice:
- Using **Ansible** for server automation
- Managing sensitive data with **Ansible Vault**
- Writing `docker-compose.yml` for a multi-container environment
- Building and deploying a Python API
- Setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy
- Orchestrating services with environment variables and health checks

This is close to a real-world production workflow used by DevOps engineers.

### Tech Stack
- **Ansible** – automation and provisioning
- **Docker** – containerization
- **Docker Compose** – multi-service orchestration
- **Python + Flask** – API implementation
- **PostgreSQL** – database
- **Nginx** – reverse proxy

---

### High-Level Deployment Flow
1. **Local (Dev Machine)** – You run the Ansible playbook targeting the production server.
2. **Ansible Tasks** – Install Docker & Compose, copy application files, templates, configs, and secrets.
3. **Docker Compose** – Starts PostgreSQL, Flask API, and Nginx in the correct order with health checks.
4. **Result** – Your services are running and accessible via the server’s IP.

If something does not work or does not start, try to find the error and fix it, learn how to do it and solve errors, and you will never repeat it again.

Good luck! 😊
